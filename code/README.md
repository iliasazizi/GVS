# Vector Search Algorithms

A collection of **graph-based and hashing-based similarity search algorithms** with implementations and experiments. Each folder corresponds to a specific algorithm, containing the necessary code, data, and instructions to run the experiments.

## Folder Structure

- **HNSW**: Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs  
- **VAMANA**: Efficient Graph Construction for Nearest Neighbor Search  
- **ELPIS**: Energy-efficient Search through Learned Prioritization Strategies  
- **NSG**: Navigating Spreading-out Graph  
- **SSG**: Small-World Proximity Graph  
- **EFANNA**: Efficient Nearest Neighbor Algorithm  
- **HCNNG**: Hill-Climbing Navigable Neighborhood Graph  
- **NGT**: Neighborhood Graph Trees  
- **SPTAG**: Space Partition Tree and Graph  
- **LSHAPG**: Locality-Sensitive Hashing with Approximate Proximity Graph  

- **DPG**: Dynamic Proximity Graph  
- **KGRAPH**: K-nearest Neighbor Graph  

Each algorithm folder contains:  
- **`/code`**: Implementations and scripts  
- **`/data`**: Parameters and  configurations

## Running the Code
 - Navigate to the desired method folder (e.g., cd HNSW).
 - Follow the specific instructions in the folder's README.md to install dependencies and run experiments.
